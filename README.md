# Project Amber
## A Data-Driven Approach to Rapid Response in Stranger Abduction Cases

The AMBER Alert system is designed to notify the public when a child abduction occurs, particularly when law enforcement believes the child is in imminent danger. These alerts aim to mobilize public awareness and increase the likelihood of a safe recovery.

Statistically, most abductions involve individuals known to the child:

- Approximately 50% involve non-custodial parents or family members

- Around 30% involve acquaintances such as neighbors or babysitters

These cases often benefit from pre-existing relationships and identifiable leads, which typically lead to high closure rates.

However, the remaining ~20% of cases involve strangers—and these are significantly more dangerous and difficult to resolve:

- 40–50% of stranger abductions result in homicide

- Approximately 76% of those homicides occur within the first 3 hours of abduction

These time constraints place extreme pressure on the initial phase of the investigation, where any delay may critically reduce the chance of recovery.

## Objective

Project Amber is a research-driven tool designed to support rapid analysis of AMBER Alert data during the early window of a suspected stranger abduction. The project focuses on developing an analytical framework capable of integrating public and semi-structured data sources in near-real time.

## Methodology

The system combines:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): to extract structured information from alert texts
- Geospatial Analysis (GIS) and Routing: to estimate suspect travel radii and filter high-probability locations
- Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT): including vehicle registration lookup, address resolution, and social media observation
- Traffic Surveillance Integration: to monitor DOT cameras and corroborate possible sightings
