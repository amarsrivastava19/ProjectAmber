# ProjectAmber
## A rapid response system for Amber Alerts

The Amber Alert system is a service that notifies the public of a child abduction in progress. This ensures that everyday citizens can keep an eye out for suspicious vehicles or individuals (especially if they match the alert's descriptions). 

The vast majority of abduction cases are done by those who are familiar with the child in question: roughly 50% of abductions are commited by a non-custodial parent or family member, and roughly 30% of cases are perpetrated by acquaintances (neighbors, babysitters, etc.). These cases typically have a high success and closure rate given the close relationships between all parties involved.


The remaining 20% of cases involve complete strangers abducting the victim, and these are the most dangerous and difficult cases to resolve. These perpetrators often have antisocial disorders or paraphillia, and pose a high and immediate risk to the victim in question. 

For context, roughly 40-50% of stranger abductions lead to murder. Worse still, 75% of these murders are committed within just 3 hours of abduction. 


Thus, its absolutely critical that a criminal investigation can be conducted quickly and efficiently. The characteristic timescales involved are in the minutes. 



Project Amber seeks to build an analytical apparatus which can combine multiple sources of publically available data to assist law enforcement in resolving these most dangerous abduction cases. It combines OSINT, SIGINT, and GIS Routing to identify high probability zones of where suspects may be within the first 3 hours of an Amber Alert.
